A Package to Draw 3-Dimensional Spheres on TikZ

I'm trying to write a package to draw 3-dimensional spheres, which is based on Tomas M. Trzeciak's <a href="http://www.texample.net/tikz/examples/map-projections/">example</a> on <a href="http://www.texample.net/">texample</a>.

I'm really at an early stage. I will try to document it better after shaping it.

Here is an example.
